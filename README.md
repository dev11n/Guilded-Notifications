# Guilded-Notifications
## What does it do?
Whenever you get a message (`MessageCreated` -> Guilded.NET), it flashes the Guilded icon in your taskbar.

## Why?
Because Guilded's notifications are broken, and you may want to get that orange flash as a bullet-proof way of never missing a message.

Or as me, use Do not Disturb and still get notifications. *because the red color looks better than the other ones*
